# 🐝 The Hive – Job Swiping App  
> A CS 309 Project by Team `MK_1_8`

## 📘 Project Description

**The Hive** is a mobile-first job swiping platform – think **Tinder for internships and jobs**. Our goal is to streamline the application process for students and simplify candidate management for recruiters and companies.

The app includes:
- Swipe-based job matching

- Weekly goal tracking

---

## 🚀 Features

### For Students
- ✅ Swipe to apply or skip job listings

---

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

Begin swiping through curated job listings.

Matches lead to in-app chat with employers.

Employers manage listings and view applicants.

Admin oversees all data and activity on the platform.
